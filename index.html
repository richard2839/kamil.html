<strong> <em> Economics </em></strong> 
is a social science that studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.
Adam Smiths known as the father of economics defined economics in his book the WEALTH OF NATIONS as " an enquiry in to nature and causes
 of wcealth of nations. 
<p> scarcity on the other hand is the limitedness in supply of recources in relation to huma wants </p>

<p> 
example of opportunity cost;
the items below shows my indivisdual wants for resuming of my school in 2024
<ul> 
	<li>SHOES        -     10$ </li>
	<li> BAG         -     5$</li>
	<li> UNIFORM     -     20$ </li>
	<li> CHOP BOX    -     25$</li>
</ul>
if I am given an income of 25$ and I decide to purchase bag and uniform instead of chop box, then the 
opportunity cost of purchasing bag and uniform is chop box.
